# woof-dom
test
An experiment in creating a simple web app with a modern architecture, but no dependencies. It seems strange to include 60kb of React, et al, when the actual app code totals far less than that...

Just playing around with:
* React-style virtual dom and component structure
* Redux-style `(state, action) -> state` state management
* Type checking/static analysis via Flow or TypeScript
